# RProgramming-Coursera_Week2
Control Structures, Functions, Scoping Rules. Assignment is Air Pollution Monitoring data set.

This week is all about functions and about controlling the flow of an R program. We start with control structures (like if-else, and for loops) and then move on to writing functions. Next, we discuss the lexical scoping features of the language and how they can be used in interesting ways, particularly for statistical applications.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this week you should be able to:

Write an if-else expression
Write a for loop, a while loop, and a repeat loop
Define a function in R and specify its return value [see Functions Part 1 and Part 2]
Describe how R binds a value to a symbol via the search list
Define what lexical scoping is with respect to how the value of free variables are resolved in R
Describe the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping rules
Convert a character string representing a date/time into an R datetime object. [see Dates and Times]
